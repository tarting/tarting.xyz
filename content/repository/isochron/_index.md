Code for fitting isochrons on uranium-thorium-lead (U-Th-Pb) isotope data.
A technical consequence of measuring multiple isotopes of the same element is that the associated errors are highly corellated. 
The U-Th-Pb isotope systems consists of three coupled decay systems: <sup>238</sup>U to <sup>206</sup>Pb, <sup>235</sup>U to <sup>207</sup>Pb and <sup>232</sup>Th to <sup>208</sup>Pb. 
Therefore to obtain the highest amount of geochronological information, multiple lead isotopes are measured in parallel.
