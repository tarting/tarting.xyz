A Python 3 module and command line tool for reducing Double Spike Isotope measurements acquired on the IsoprobeT and Phoenix instruments at the Geology Section at the University of Copenhagen. This piece of software was developed in particular for doing data reduction on chromium isotope measurements. New isotope systems are easily implemented using json configuration files, and new spikes can also be calibrated automatically on the basis of measured spike-standard mixtures.
